# pdn-one-dimensional-cellular-automata-plugin
A Paint.NET plugin I built to render any ruleset of one-dimensional cellular automata (0 - 255).

Built using the Paint.NET framework in C#.

<h1>How to install:</h1>

1.  Download the zip file, extract the files, and execute the batch file Install_oneDautomata.bat.

2.  If you see a success ascii text, then you have successfully installed it.

3.  Upon opening Paint.NET after a successful installation, choose Effects, Render, oneDautomata.

  Below are some rendering examples from what can be achieved with this plugin.
